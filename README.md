# PetsPaw App

## üëâ [Deploy](https://petspaw-algolj.netlify.app/) üëà

## How to start?

This is a regular Next.JS project.

1. You need to install NodeJS on your workstation.
2. Go to the root folder in the server and write in the console npm i. This would install all required dependencies.
3. After installation of the dependencies, you simply start the app itself using the command npm run dev.
4. It works! Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and enjoy.

<small>P.S. If you want to build an application, the npm run build command will help you with this.</small>

## What technologies did I use in this project?

1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/);
2. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/);
3. [React](https://reactjs.org/);
4. [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/);
5. [Redux Toolkit ( RTK Query )](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/);
6. [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) ( also Actions in the GitHub, but it makes no sense to single it out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è );
7. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/);
8. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ( [airbnb config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) );
9. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) ( I really love the deploy Previews in branches).

## What are the highlights of the project?

1. SSG for pages with cat breeds;
2. Localization in Ukrainian and English ( i18n ).

## What hasn‚Äôt been yet implemented?

1. Tablet and mobile view;
2. Unit tests.

<small>P.S. I have done these features in other projects, specifically adaptive and responsive design. Maybe I'll add them to this project later.</small>
